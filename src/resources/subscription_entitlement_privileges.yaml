  summary: Remove a privilege from a subscription entitlement override
  description: This endpoint removes a specific privilege override from a subscription entitlement. This only works with privileges that are part of a feature specifically added to this subscription as an override. You cannot remove privileges from plan entitlements - only subscription-specific overrides can be removed.
