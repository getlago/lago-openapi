  summary: Override a charge for a subscription
  description: |-
    This endpoint creates or updates a charge override for a specific subscription.
    If the subscription does not have a plan override yet, one will be created automatically.
    The charge override allows customizing specific charge properties (invoice_display_name, min_amount_cents, properties, filters, taxes, applied_pricing_unit) without affecting the original plan charge.
    This is a premium feature.
