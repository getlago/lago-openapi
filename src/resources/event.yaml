  summary: Retrieve a specific event
  description: |
    This endpoint is used for retrieving a specific usage measurement event that has been sent to a customer or a subscription.

    Note that transaction_id is unique per external_subscription_id so multiple subscriptions can share the same transaction_id. This endpoint will only return the first event found with the given transaction_id.

    WARNING: If your Lago organization is configured to use the Clickhouse-based event pipeline, multiple events can share the same `transaction_id` (with different timestamps). This endpoint will only return the first event found.
