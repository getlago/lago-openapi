  summary: Void an invoice
  description: |-
    This endpoint is used for voiding an invoice.
    • When no body parameters are provided, the invoice can be voided only if it is in a `finalized` status and its payment status is NOT `succeeded`.
    • When `generate_credit_note` is provided (optionally with `refund_amount` and/or `credit_amount`), this validation is bypassed: the invoice is forcibly voided and a credit note is generated. If the specified refund/credit amounts do not cover the full invoice total, the remainder is issued on a second credit note that is created and immediately voided.
