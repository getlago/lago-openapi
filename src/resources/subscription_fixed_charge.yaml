  summary: Override a fixed charge for a subscription
  description: |-
    This endpoint creates or updates a fixed charge override for a specific subscription.
    If the subscription does not have a plan override yet, one will be created automatically.
    The fixed charge override allows customizing specific fixed charge properties (invoice_display_name, units, properties, taxes) without affecting the original plan fixed charge.
    This is a premium feature.
