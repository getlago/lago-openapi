      Defines if the billable metric is persisted billing period over billing period.

      - If set to `true`: the accumulated number of units calculated from the previous billing period is persisted to the next billing period.
      - If set to `false`: the accumulated number of units is reset to 0 at the end of the billing period.
      - If not defined in the request, default value is `false`.
