      - `credit`: A credit note is generated for the unused subscription time. The unused amount is credited back to the customer.
      - `refund`: A credit note is generated for the unused subscription time. If the invoice is paid or partially paid, the unused paid amount is refunded; any unpaid unused amount is credited back to the customer.
      - `offset`: A credit note is generated for the unused subscription time. If the invoice is paid or partially paid, the unused paid amount is refunded; any unpaid unused amount is applied to the invoice reducing its amount due.
      - `skip`: No credit note is generated for the unused subscription time.

      _Note: This field is only applicable to pay-in-advance plans and will be `null` for pay-in-arrears plans._
