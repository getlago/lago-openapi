    type: object

      Optionally, you can create a pre-authorization on the customer's card before creating a subscription. This process places a temporary hold (capture) for a specified amount on the customer's account, but does not actually withdraw the funds.

      Important notes:
        - The final amount due for the subscription is not known at the time of creation; it is determined only after the invoice is finalized.
        - The payment intent generated for pre-authorization cannot be reused, as the final invoice amount may exceed the authorized amount.
        - The payment intent is canceled immediately after creation, but this cancellation occurs asynchronously.
        - For these reasons, it is recommended to use a small amount (such as $1) for pre-authorization. While this does not guarantee sufficient funds for the final payment, it helps reduce the likelihood of payment errors.
