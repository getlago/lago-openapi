  lago_id:
    type: string
    format: 'uuid'
    example: '1a901a90-1a90-1a90-1a90-1a901a901a90'
    description: Unique identifier assigned to the event within the Lago application. This ID is exclusively created by Lago and serves as a unique identifier for the event's record within the Lago system
  transaction_id:
    type: string
    example: 'transaction_1234567890'
    description: This field represents a unique identifier for the event. It is crucial for ensuring idempotency, meaning that each event can be uniquely identified and processed without causing any unintended side effects.
  lago_customer_id:
    type: string
    format: 'uuid'
    example: '1a901a90-1a90-1a90-1a90-1a901a901a90'
    description: Unique identifier assigned to the customer within the Lago application. This ID is exclusively created by Lago and serves as a unique identifier for the customer's record within the Lago system
  external_customer_id:
    type: string
    example: '5eb02857-a71e-4ea2-bcf9-57d3a41bc6ba'
    description: The customer external unique identifier (provided by your own application). This field is optional if you send the `external_subscription_id`, targeting a specific subscription.
  code:
    type: string
    example: 'storage'
    description: The code that identifies a targeted billable metric. It is essential that this code matches the `code` property of one of your active billable metrics. If the provided code does not correspond to any active billable metric, it will be ignored during the process.
  timestamp:
    type: string
    format: 'date-time'
    example: '2022-04-29T08:59:51.123Z'
    description: This field captures the Unix timestamp in seconds indicating the occurrence of the event in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). If this timestamp is not provided, the API will automatically set it to the time of event reception.
  properties:
    type: object
    description: This field represents additional properties associated with the event, which are utilized in the calculation of the final fee. This object becomes mandatory when the targeted billable metric employs a `sum_agg`, `max_agg`, or `unique_count_agg` aggregation method. However, when using a simple `count_agg`, this object is not required.
    properties:
      operation_type:
        type: string
        description: The `operation_type` field is only necessary when adding or removing a specific unit when the targeted billable metric adopts a `unique_count_agg` aggregation method. In other cases, the `operation_type` field is not required. The valid values for the `operation_type` field are `add` or `remove`, which indicate whether the unit is being added or removed from the unique count aggregation, respectively.
        enum:
          - add
          - remove

    example: '1a901a90-1a90-1a90-1a90-1a901a901a90'
    description: Unique identifier assigned to the subscription within the Lago application. This ID is exclusively created by Lago and serves as a unique identifier for the subscriptionâ€™s record within the Lago system
  external_subscription_id:
    type: string
    example: 'sub_1234567890'
    description: The unique identifier of the subscription within your application. It is a mandatory field when the customer possesses multiple subscriptions or when the `external_customer_id` is not provided.
  created_at:
    type: string
    format: 'date-time'
    example: '2022-04-29T08:59:51Z'
    description: The creation date of the event's record in the Lago application, presented in the ISO 8601 datetime format, specifically in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It provides the precise timestamp of when the event's record was created within the Lago application
